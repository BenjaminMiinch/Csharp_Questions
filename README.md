# Csharp_Questions
Q: What is a namespace?
A: A namespace is a set of named program regions used to limit the scope of variables inside the program. 

Q: What are value types?
A: Value types are the memory addresses that data is occupying.

Q: What are reference types?
A: Reference types are data types that store a reference to their data and not the actual data itself.

Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
A: Automatic propterties are used when there is no other logic needed when making a declaration. They are useful because they save time for coders.

Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
A: The using statement lets the system use disposable objects in the right way

Q: What are dynamic type variables?
A: Dynamic type variables don't need to be initialized and can be changed over time to different types. Like from a double to a float.

Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
A: The "is" operator determines whether or not if an object is type compatiable with another given object.

Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
A: Generics are used to write instantiated code for certain parameters.

Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
A: The scope is the capability for one object or item to access a public member of any class.

Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
A: Yes, this is allowed, you just have to use the keyword "params"

Q: How do you sort an array?
A: You sort an array by starting in the first data point of the array and then comparing the value stored in that data point to the next value at the next data point to see if the value is higher than the item to its right. If the left value is more than the right, then you swap the values. You continue to iterate through the array and sort these items until they are all sorted. This is most often done with a loop.

Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
A: A nullable type is a value that can be used in both value and reference data types. It's purpose is to determine if a given memory space is empty or not.

Q: What is an enumeration?
A: Using the keyword 'enum', enumeration is a distinct type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.

Q: What is inheritance?
A: This is a feature of objects in C sharp that allows objects to learn behavior and data from other different unrelated classes.

Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
A: No, mulitple inheritance from different classes is not supported on C#.

Q: What is the purpose of as operator
A: The 'as' operator is used to perform different conversions between compatiable data types.

Q: What is an object?
A: An object is an instance of a given class that has been created.

Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
A: The difference between a struct and a class is that a struct is a value type and a class is a reference type.

Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A: The difference between continue and break statements is that after a contiune is called, the loop runs 1 more time than the break statement. They both essentially serve the same purpose.

Q: What is this and how is it used?
A: "this" is a keyword used to refer to the instance of a given class that is currently selected.

Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
A: Try and catch are to handle an exception, Try is used until an exception is thrown and catch is there to handle those exceptions.

Q: How is exception handling done?
A: Exception handling is done through try catch blocks.

Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
A: Finally is used in try catch as a final outcome no matter if there is an exception or not.

Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
A: In an ArrayList, you can increase or decrease the size dynamically opposed to an Array. Also, an array cannot accept null while an ArrayList can.

Q: Define constructor.
A: It is a method of a class

Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
A: Var can be used when it is a local variable and you initialize it in the same statement.

Q: What is an abstract class?
A: An abstract class is used to define a base class.

Q: What is an interface?
A: An interface declares methods

Q: What is a method?
A: a method is a group of statements that perfom a function

Q: What is a property?
A: They are members of classes, structures and interfaces that actually have a name

Q: What is an access specifier?
A: An access specifier gives certain accesses to types and members.

Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
A: There are 6 major access specifiers, 1. Public: it gives access to all code. 2. Private: can only be accessed by code in the same struct or class, 3. Protected: only in the same class or sublclass, 4. Internal: Any code in that is in the same assembly, 5. Protected Internal: Any code in any assembly, and 6. Private Protected: Only in the assembly that declares it, same class, or a type that is from the same class.

Q: What is a collection?
A: A collection holds a set of classes.

Q: What is a Hash Table?
A: A hash table is used when you access elements using the keyword 'key'.
